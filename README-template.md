## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I had trouble initially understanding the concept of CSS grid and how to properly apply it to make this solution to the challenge work. I have a better understanding now of how to properly use grid and to make more complex layouts with it.

### Continued development

Although I gained greater understanding of the concepts I still need alot of practice with them and will continue to gain a greater grasp on the subject.

### Useful resources

- [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/@TraversyMedia) - This helped me with the grid layout and is a go to source of information for me.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Recommend getting to know this resource well.
